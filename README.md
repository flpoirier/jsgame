<h1>Sunset Boulevard</h1>

Sunset Boulevard is a browser game built using JavaScript and HTML Canvas. The object of the game is for the player to cross the bridge before the sun sets, while dodging asteroids that rain from the sky. Transparent, concentric circles are used to produce a sunset effect, while stars gradually appear as the sky gets darker.

Sunset Boulevard uses event listeners to move based on player keyboard input, as well as trigonometry to calculate the trajectories of the player avatar and the asteroid obstacles. The embedded audio is "Error", by Lemon Demon. The volume icons were created by Font Awesome.
