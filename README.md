This will, at some point, be a Mario-ish runner game -- character will jump to get coins, and either jump over chasms or jump up stairs (or both, I'm still figuring that out). It will mostly be coded in vanilla JS. Controls will be arrow keys (to move) and the space bar (to jump).

Features:

- Blue sky background with randomly generated clouds floating past.
- Green grass floor with variable height (steps and/or chasms).
- Floating coins
- A player avatar (probably a small cartoon human)
- A running count of the number of captured coins at the top right of the screen and of the number of lives

Maybe:

- Monsters that go back and forth and make you lose a life if you hit them
- A win condition: a castle you can reach if you successfully pass all the monsters / jump over all the caverns
